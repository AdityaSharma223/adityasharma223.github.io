        VIM plugings are used to make your VIM feel more comfortable, these include the airline (the mode display at the bottom) or auto complete something you may find in more modern or normie friendly editors (btw VIM does have a built in autocomplete feature, try Ctrl-N :p). These plugins can be installed with the help of plugin managers, there are a whole bunch of them but the one that I use is <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/VIM-plug">VIM Plug</a> it is fast and easy to use.
        I knew a little about VIM plugins and plugin managers but was a little apprehensive, let me tell u from 
        experience there is nothing to be scared of. It is very simple and almost kind of intuitive to use. <br><br>
        After the installation you just have to add this to your $HOME/.vimrc: <br><br>
        <code> 
            call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')<br>

            " write your plugins here <br>
            " Plug 'plugin name' <br>

            call plug#end() <br>
        </code><br><br>
        This is how my vim looks like: <br><br>
